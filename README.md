# AITUHackDay: Creative Industry.EdTech
The hackathon is organized as part of the Creative Spark, British Council: High Education Enterprise Program.

Every time students interact with the information systems of their university – whether it is entering an electronic library (e-library), or sending an answer to a task in a virtual learning environment (Moodle, Canvas, etc) – they leave their Digital Footprint. Learning Analytics or Educational Data Mining – this is the process of using such data to improve the education system. Educational analytics as a separate area of data analysis has achieved significant success in many applied tasks of higher education: learning dashboards, adaptive feedback, early warning systems, recommendation systems for students and personalized student support.

Task statement:
You will have to perform a comprehensive analysis of an open data set that
was extracted from the information systems of a higher educational institution. It is necessary
to perform the following tasks:
• carefully examine the data;
• make a preliminary (exploratory) analysis of the data;
• clear of unnecessary or useless information (noise);
• combine data into one table (denormalization);
• identify hidden facts and patterns, various patterns of behavior
of students, anomalies, etc.;
• if useful hypotheses are found, check them;
• build dashboards (dashboards) for students,
teachers and administrators of the university (e.g., daily/weekly
activity of students, statistics of work with content, identification of lagging
students, etc.).
• try to build predictive analytics (a model for classification).


Won with 2 place.
