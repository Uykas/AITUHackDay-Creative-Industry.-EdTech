# AITUHackDay: Creative Industry.EdTech
The hackathon is organized as part of the Creative Spark, British Council: High Education Enterprise Program.
Every time students interact with the information systems of their university – whether it is entering an electronic library (e-library), or sending an answer to a task in a virtual learning environment (Moodle, Canvas, etc) – they leave their Digital Footprint. Learning Analytics or Educational Data Mining – this is the process of using such data to improve the education system. Educational analytics as a separate area of data analysis has achieved significant success in many applied tasks of higher education: learning dashboards, adaptive feedback, early warning systems, recommendation systems for students and personalized student support.

Won with 2 place.
